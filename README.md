## What I've Learned
Throughout the formation, I have studied and implemented the following topics:

- **SwiftUI Basics**: Understanding views, modifiers, and layout system.
- **Navigation & Data Flow**: Implementing NavigationStack, passing data between views, and using EnvironmentObject.
- **State Management**: Using @State, @Binding, and @Environment to manage data efficiently.
- **Animations & Gestures**: Creating smooth animations and handling user interactions with gestures.
